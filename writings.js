        content:    `I suppose she went to walk her phone 
                    then I noticed she was following me.
                    She didn't mind me overhearing her —
                    "The park smells like sperm," she said,
                    "The chestnut trees are blossoming."

                    I threw a stick, but the dog didn't respond.
                    As I stood still, she paused too,
                    keeping the distance between us intact.
                    She said, "Now he goes out every night,
                    but when we were together,
                    he always wanted to stay in."

                    In the pond, a lone duckling swam in circles.
                    I tried to catch it, but it squeaked and fluttered off.
                    Closing the distance, the lady said:
                    "Best to leave it alone,
                    let nature take its course."
                    We both left in opposite directions.

                    Later, we reunited at the car park.
                    She hung up, got in, and while driving off,
                    she spoke with great confidence,
                    but I couldn't read her lips,
                    so I shrugged and waved, flimsily.`

        content: `I'm no good at protesting
and horrible at changing bad habits,
so what am I to do to alleviate the mess?

I sit on the wobbly chair on the grass.
I drink coffee; at minimum,
I do not want to be a nuisance.

A blackbird makes me laugh
by singing a tune from a discontinued phone.

Is waiting harmful?
The brain uses about 20 watts,
whether in thought or idle.
Most of its work is not
suitable for publication.

I come up with a book title:
North of the North Pole,
subtitled:
How a Pre-Geometric Phase
Ends in a Big Bang.

I write papers on the porous in-group
out-group boundaries
as an argument
for early human migration success.

As I feel my finger bones tingle,
as if a large cat is about to jump on me,
I see a snail on the garden path.
Even if it makes it to the other side,
my neighbour smashes them with stones
to keep her sweet peas safe.

The blackbird flies into the hedge,
where it stays silent.
My mother calls me —
the newspaper has arrived.`
