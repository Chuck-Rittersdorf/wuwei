                    then I noticed she was following me.
                    She didn't mind me overhearing her -
                    "The park smells like sperm," she said,
                    "The chestnut trees are blossoming."

                    I threw a stick, but the dog didn't respond.
                    As I stood still, she paused too,
                    keeping the distance between us intact.
                    She said, "Now he goes out every night,
                    but when we were together,
                    he always wanted to stay in."

                    In the pond, a lone duckling swam in circles.
                    I tried to catch it, but it squeaked and fluttered off.
                    Closing the distance, the lady said:
                    "Best to leave it alone,
                    let nature take its course."
                    We both left in opposite directions.

                    Later, we reunited at the car park.
                    She hung up, got in, and while driving off,
                    she spoke with great confidence,
                    but I couldn't read her lips,
                    so I shrugged and waved, flimsily.`
